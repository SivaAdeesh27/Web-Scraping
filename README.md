# Web Scraping and Scheduling Script

This script is designed to perform web scraping of specific URLs and schedule the scraping process to run at regular intervals. It utilizes the `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `schedule` libraries to fetch HTML content, extract relevant information, and automate the scraping process.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library
- `schedule` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 schedule


## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.

2. Open the script file `webscrapeautomation.py` in a text editor.

3. Modify the following variables as per your requirements:

   - `invalid_urls`: List of invalid URLs to skip during scraping.
   - `main_urls`: List of main URLs to scrape.
   - `output_files`: List of output file names to save the scraped content.

4. Save the script file.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

6. Run the script using the following command:

python webscrapeautomation.py


The script will run immediately and start scraping the specified URLs. It will save the extracted content to the output files.

7. The script will automatically schedule the next run based on a random time interval between 24 to 28 hours. It will continue running and scraping at the scheduled times.

## Customization

You can customize the script further based on your specific needs. Here are some possible modifications:

- Adjust the list of `main_urls` and `output_files` to scrape different websites or pages.
- Modify the scraping logic in the `main` function to extract specific information from web pages.
- Customize the time interval for scheduling by modifying the `get_next_run_time` function.

## Notes

- Ensure that you comply with the terms of service and legal requirements of the websites you are scraping. Respect their policies and do not abuse or overload their servers.
- This script is provided as an example and should be used responsibly and within the bounds of applicable laws and regulations.
